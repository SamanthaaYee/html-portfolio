# personal-website
In the development of my personal website, my primary goals were to use this project as a way to hone in on my design skills and that every line of code would be written by me (i.e. no templates or frameworks). I wanted to ensure that I had full creative control of my website and build upon my front-end development abilities. Iâ€™m happy to say, in the launching of my website, that I achieved both of these goals. 

My personal website was designed on Figma, taking inspiration from minimalist and clean websites I look up to. I built it with HTML for initial structure, CSS to style the elements and JavaScript to add functionality like a contact page. Check it out!
